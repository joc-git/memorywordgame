# memorywordgame

Hello! This is my first upload project in python! 
Since I live and study in Germany, I am in the process of learning the language. So I had the idea of creating a memory game using tkinter to have fun and also memorize some words. The meaning of it and also how to write it.

Memory Word game: german words vs english translate
Memory consists in finding pairs of words, german word and its translation in English.
One player
